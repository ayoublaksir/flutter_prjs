    title: 'Perfect Shaving Technique',
    category: 'skincare',
    shortDescription:
        'Master the art of shaving for smooth skin without irritation.',
    fullContent: '''
Proper shaving technique prevents irritation, ingrown hairs, and razor burn while achieving a smooth, comfortable shave.

Pre-Shave Preparation:
1. Timing Matters
- Shave after showering (softens hair)
- Warm water opens pores
- Never shave dry skin
- Allow 3-5 minutes for hair to soften

2. Pre-Shave Oil (Optional but Beneficial)
- Creates protective barrier
- Further softens facial hair
- Reduces friction and irritation
- Apply thin layer before shaving cream

The Perfect Shave Steps:
1. Choose Quality Products
Shaving Cream/Soap:
• Rich, protective lather
• Moisturizing ingredients
• Fragrance-free for sensitive skin
• Avoid aerosol foams (less protection)

2. Razor Selection
Safety Razors:
- Single blade reduces irritation
- More control over pressure
- Requires technique but gentler
- Replace blades frequently

Multi-Blade Cartridges:
- Convenient and quick
- Good for beginners
- More expensive long-term
- Can cause more irritation

3. Proper Technique
First Pass:
- Shave WITH the grain
- Use light pressure
- Short, controlled strokes
- Rinse blade frequently

Second Pass (if needed):
- Re-apply shaving cream
- Shave ACROSS the grain
- Never against grain on first tries
- Stop if irritation occurs

4. Post-Shave Care
Immediate Care:
- Rinse with cool water
- Pat (don't rub) dry
- Apply alcohol-free aftershave
- Use moisturizer while skin is damp

Aftershave Options:
• Aloe vera gel (soothing)
• Witch hazel (antiseptic)
• Moisturizing balm (hydrating)
• Nothing with alcohol or menthol

Common Shaving Mistakes:
• Using dull blades
• Applying too much pressure
• Shaving against grain immediately
• Skipping pre-shave preparation
• Using products with alcohol
• Shaving too frequently

Dealing with Problem Areas:
Sensitive Neck:

Ingrown Hairs:
- Exfoliate gently 2-3x weekly
- Use salicylic acid products
- Don't pick or squeeze

Shaving Schedule:

Every Other Day:

Travel Shaving:
