        'Learn why double cleansing is essential for removing makeup, sunscreen, and impurities.',
    fullContent: '''
Double cleansing is a two-step process that uses an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser. This method ensures thorough removal of both oil-soluble and water-soluble impurities.

Step 1: Oil-based cleanser
- Breaks down makeup, sunscreen, and sebum
- Massage gently for 1-2 minutes
- Remove with warm water

Step 2: Water-based cleanser
- Removes remaining residue and water-based impurities
- Cleanses deeper into pores
- Prepares skin for the rest of your routine

Benefits:
• Deeper cleansing
• Prevents breakouts
• Better product absorption
• Improved skin texture

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
• Using too much pressure
• Skipping the first step
• Using wrong oil for your skin type
• Not removing oil completely
